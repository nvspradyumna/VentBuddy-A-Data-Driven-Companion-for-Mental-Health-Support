        "VentBuddy was developed to provide users with a safe and supportive space to express their thoughts and emotions without judgment. The chatbot takes user input in the form of free text and analyzes it using a trained classification model to identify the underlying emotional category. Based on the predicted category, VentBuddy generates an empathetic and supportive response tailored to the user’s emotional state. The system is designed to encourage emotional expression while clearly avoiding medical advice or diagnosis."
